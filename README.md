# Emotion Detection Model

## Overview:
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect emotions from facial expressions in images. The aim is to classify emotions into predefined categories to support applications in affective computing and user interaction.

### Problem Statement:
Detecting emotions from images is challenging due to variations in facial expressions, lighting, and image quality. This model automates the emotion recognition process, which can be useful in fields such as user experience research and mental health monitoring.

### Business Goal:
Develop a model to classify facial expressions into one of the following emotion categories:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise
- Neutral
Accurate emotion classification can enhance user interaction and provide valuable insights into emotional states.

### Dataset:
The dataset comprises images of facial expressions categorized into seven emotions. It includes 28,709 training images and 7,178 validation images. The images are processed in grayscale with a target size of 48x48 pixels.

### Steps and Implementation:
1. Import Libraries
- Import the necessary libraries
2. Explore Dataset
- Visualize sample images from the dataset to understand the data distribution.

3. Prepare Data for Training
- Load images using ImageDataGenerator.
- Preprocess images for model input.

4. Define Model
- Implement a CNN with layers of Conv2D, BatchNormalization, Activation, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers to classify images into emotion categories.

5. Train the Model
- Train the CNN model for 15 epochs with model checkpoints to save the best weights.

6. Evaluate the Model
- Assess model performance on validation data and plot loss and accuracy graphs.

7. Save the Model
- Save the trained model architecture and weights for future use.
